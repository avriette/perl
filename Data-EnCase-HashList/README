Data-EnCase-HashList version 0.1
================================

It became apparent to me that it might be useful to have a tool to convert
long lists of hashes produced by e.g., cksum(1) into something that EnCase can
use.

This is just that, in a perl module, so that I can write a "front-end" for it
without carrying all that code around in a script that should be a oneliner.
Ish.
