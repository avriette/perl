# So there’s this javascript code in your perl directory
Yeah. About that. I keep trying to write perl and I keep going, *god, this is awful, why is perl still so, bleh, baroque or something?* I mean, I love perl. A lot. I really, really do. I’ve written tens upon tens of thousands of lines of perl code in the twenty years I have been hacking perl.

But it hasn’t changed. At all. Well, I mea, it’s changed a little. But it’s not the sexy language that, say, [node](https://www.nodejs.org/) and [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/‎) are. Perl’s package management system (and build system!) feel like they’re well over ten years old. *Because they are!*

Plus, I already know perl. So I’m taking this “mudra” project, and I’m writing bits and pieces of it in node – I may write *all* of it in node – and hopefully this results in my being moderately familiar with the language.

Because when I tell people that I am an expert perl hacker, they look at me and they can’t decide whether I should be some bearded forty-year-old fat guy or whether I am a really misguided CGI programmer. I mean, perl is great, and I’ve done just about everything I can do in perl. But nobody has asked me whether I can write perl in, oh, about ten years.

Today they want newer, sexier things. And javascript, I guess, is that.

Boy, do I wish I could go back to 2004 and tell myself, “yeah, I know, it’s ugly as sin and it’s actually the reason the world is shit, but go ahead and learn it. You’l wish you had in ten years.”

Please don’t be *too* angry with me.
