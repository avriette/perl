These are very, very old and should probably not be taken
as examples of how to do ANYTHING, let alone write proper
perl code, or an irc interaction. Most of these date from
2001-2003.

I've uploaded them here for historic purposes, so people 
who worked on this code can have a look at stuff they wrote
ages ago.

I do plan to port most of this to modern perl and proper,
professional style.

I may never get to it, though.

And, please, don't judge me by code I wrote when I was twenty.
